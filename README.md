### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Fall 2019

+ Projec title: Lyrics Throughout Time
+ This project is conducted by Adam Kravitz

+ Project summary: This project explores music through the decades from the 1960s to the 2010s as well as exploring the traits of different music genres. Most of the exploration are based around 2 main concepts, 1, which is how repetitive songs are lyrically. 2, which is what topics do songs talk about. These 2 ideas me to explore 3 different questions. The data was pre-processed
using Text_Processing.Rmd saved in the data file, then processed using Data_story.Rmd in the output and doc file.

Question:

1.Are the songs from the 60s and 70s more repetitive than songs from the 2000s and 2010s?
2.Are different genres better mediums for different ideas?
3. Can you tell the genre of a song just but its repetitiveness (frequency of the words)?
